# LiveMeUp

## What is LiveMeUp
LiveMeUp offers a comprehensive solution for Shopify merchants to easily integrate Live Shopping, Replay Shopping, and shoppable videos into their stores. For nearly two years, LiveMeUp has been available on the Shopify App Store and is currently the top-ranked app for Live Shopping. It is the only app with a built-in "in-video Add to Cart" feature.

Our Live Shopping (and Replay Shopping from past events) solution looks as such on Shopify store:

<img style="margin-bottom: 2rem;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22a39110-1a16-44d6-9ade-4dda74e64d36" />

Our “widget Stories” shows a playlist of 1 to 6 shoppable videos. This widget is added to any page on the shopify store. Below is a 6 video widget example:

<img style="margin-bottom: 2rem;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c2415bc-6430-4a91-be4c-cd936ee36178" />

When the user clicks the play button, the video begins with its overlay, featuring a direct "Add to Cart" button, creating an Instagram-like experience.

### 4. How Does a User Interact with LiveMeUp in-app?

<div>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">For the live-shopping page</p>
User can either join a Live event being played in the Mobile App or watch a past show that he/she missed. During the Live show, user can ask questions in the Live Chat and browse product selection before buying it. In replay clips, user has same experience as with Live Show (except he/she can not chat)
</div>

<div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">For the “Widget Stories” block</p>
User plays full screen interactive videos promoting the product. User can select product variants (if any) and simply add  his selection in one-click to his Mobile App cart.

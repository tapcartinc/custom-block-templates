# Color Swatching using Product Title, Product Tags and Image URLs

## Description
This block shows an example on how to generate color swatches on the PDP.  Color swatching has two main elements:
1. Product Grouping
2. Swatch generating

In this example, we are using a combination of the PRDOUCT TITLE, PRODUCT TAGS, and IMAGE URLS to generate the color swatch with associated functionalities (i.e Tapcart openProduct action)

## How this block works
1. Product Grouping logic is implemented based off the PRODUCT TITLE
2. The product title is used as a base to find all related products based on a product tag.  
3. After the product grouping is sanitized, it is used to generate color swatching elements in the UI
4. The open product function is used to create functionality on each swatch.

Having trouble finding your store name?  If your Shopify URL is this: tapcart-boutique.myshopify.com, then your store name will be tapcart-boutique.  Reach out to your account manager or contact customblocks@tapcart.co if you have any questions!  

Other than this, the code will need to be heavily modified to fit your needs. This is just an example/guide to help you on your way in generating color swatches!

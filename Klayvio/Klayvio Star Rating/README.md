# Klaviyo Star Rating

## Description

What is Klaviyo Star Rating?

Klaviyo's Star Rating widget is designed to display the average star rating for a product based on customer reviews. It does not display the actual text of the reviews.

Klaviyoâ€™s newest offering is a product reviews solution that helps brands collect, analyze, and display customer reviews. Our vision is to give merchants all the data in our platform so they can drive more revenue with everything they do with us - email, push, SMS, and now reviews.

## How this block works

1. The block is positioned on the Product Detail Page (PDP) of the app. Its purpose is to display the star rating widget for a specific product.

2. When a product page is loaded, the widget makes an API call to Klaviyo. This call uses the product ID and product title as data attributes to fetch the relevant reviews for that specific product.

3. Klaviyo's API responds with the review data for the product. The widget then calculates the average star rating based on these reviews.

4. The calculated average star rating is then populated into a div with a specific class on the block. This div is updated dynamically to display the star rating on the product page.

5. The star rating widget is now visible to users visiting the product page, providing them with an average rating based on customer reviews. This helps potential customers make informed decisions about their purchases.
